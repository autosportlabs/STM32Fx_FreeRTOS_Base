STM32Fx_FreeRTOS_Base
=====================

FreeRTOS starter project for STM32 microcontrollers.

## Prerequisites
1. GNU Make
2. [gcc-arm-embedded](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded)

## Creating a new project:
1. Create (if necessary) board and CPU definitions (see existing examples for details).
2. Create an application folder in the apps directory
3. Create a config.mk file for your application (see existing examples)
4. Store your application code in the newly created directory and edit your config.mk file appropriately

## Building
1. 'cd' to the root of base project directory
2. type 'make APP=your\_app\_name'

## Debugging
1. Install openocd with support for your JTAG dongle
2. Add an openocd.cfg to your project (see existing examples)
3. Install DDD (data display debugger) (optional)
4. Type: sudo make APP=your\_app\_name openocd (this starts the
   debugger)
5. Attach your favorite debugger (gdb/ddd/insight) to the openocd
   session (a make command for ddd is included in the makefile)

## ITM Trace output
1. Download, build, and install
   [swo-tracer](https://github.com/yurovsky/swo-tracer)
2. Compile and flash your firmware
3. Start openocd with trace support (see example openocd.cfg files)
4. Start gdb and enable semihosting (make APP=your\_app gdb)
5. Launch swo-tracer and point it at the swo.log file that is
   generated by openocd (swo-tracer -t swo.log). You may need to use
   sudo
6. Use GDB to reset your firmware and any printf output should be
   displayed in the swo-tracer screen
